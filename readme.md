# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-10
### 1. Summary

Week ten of MART-341 was all about Responsive Web design in addition to using techniques learnt in previous weeks to create a new, easily accessible webpage.

Key Definitions this week were;

**RWD**-

**Margin**-Margins is the calculated space between a box/element and another element.

**Float**-Allows indicated elements to be displayed outside the normal flow of the content or webpage.

**Box Size**- Box size allow us to create the different boxes or elements that build up a webpage. It allows us to adjust width, height, colour, pixels, boarder thickness and design etc.

### Homework

This weeks webpage revolved fully around the responsive web design.  

### Issues

This week I struggled quite a bit with all the work that needed to be covered and I still am having trouble putting everything together. I found it alot more difficult than i expected to create a RWD, as I quite often I found that certain float boxes will work on one or two screens and then will be completly off on another screen. I also found that I had troble getting my words o remain within the boarders I had created, especially when changing device screens. I think I have manageded to put together something that has worked but I do know I need some improvements in RWD.

### Future Discussion

Although very difficult, I found this week exciting none the less, as once I am able to figure RWD out properly then I think I will be on the right tract to developing websites that portray my pesonal style and content preference. I looks forward to continue to work with RWD and hopefully can implement it is my furutre assignments.
